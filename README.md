# v2

august 2022 update: i have a little confession to make - i gave up (for now). i needed an updated site since my previous one still says i'm a high school senior, so i made something quick on a plane back to austin. i probably spent an hour on this total*, no tailwind, limited react usage, just plain old html css. eventually i will build the fancy website but for now this exists and looks pretty good. 

see my initial thoughts and designs from december 2021 below ⬇️

my wip website, built with next.js + tailwind

this site will eventually serve as a link shortener, personal blog, resume?, and cool internet place (tm)

i've been telling myself i want to replace my [old carrd site](https://v0.jasonaa.me/) for well over a year at this point, but i've kinda found myself stuck in a rut of designing and never building. i've been through somewhere in the range of 3-5 complete redesigns and haven't gotten anything i'm fully satisfied with. they don't look bad per se, but they don't quite give off all the vibes i want yet. eventually i came up with a design i liked, but then i thought - what if i just used all of the designs?

i was intitially meming but i realized i could actually do that so im going to do that. i'll likely do something along the lines of randomly serving a new theme/layout. still not sure on specifics - do i change it on every router transition? keep the same theme for each user session? one idea i just had while typing this is having the page kinda 'mutate' over time until it has morphed from one theme to another... idk im getting rambly at this point, might be worth looking into tho

before shipping the site should definitely:

- have epic animations / micro interactions
- include my [scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/jasonaa) posts
- look cool


here are all the designs i've been through, in descending chronological order. some of these (specifically 2.2) are kinda ugly, and 2.0 looks far too professional/boring for my liking, but i think the others have some promise... 

i'm actively building out v2.5 in the repo right now, and the others may or may not come later
